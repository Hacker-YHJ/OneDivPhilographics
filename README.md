# OneDivPhilographics
This project shows my respect to the [Philographics](http://studiocarreras.com/philographics/).

> Philographics is a series of posters that explain big ideas in simple shapes. They are the result of combining the world of philosophy with graphic design. You can get the entire set of 95 designs as a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Philographics-Big-Ideas-Simple-Shapes/dp/9063693419) or a selection of them as [posters](https://society6.com/gex6) and [postcards](http://www.amazon.com/Philographics-Postcard-Book-Genis-Carreras/dp/9063693893).

I am going to replicate this project by using only one div for each graph.

Still work in progress.
